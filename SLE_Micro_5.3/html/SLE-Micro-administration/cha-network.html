    Linux offers the necessary networking tools and features for integration
    into all types of network structures. Network access using a network card
    can be configured with YaST. Manual configuration is also possible. In
    this chapter, only the fundamental mechanisms and the relevant network
    configuration files are covered.
   </p></div></div></div></div><p>
  Linux and other Unix operating systems use the TCP/IP protocol. It is not a
  single network protocol, but a family of network protocols that offer various
  services. The protocols listed in <a class="xref" href="cha-network.html#tab-net-basic-tcpproto" title="Several protocols in the TCP/IP protocol family">Several protocols in the TCP/IP protocol family</a>
  are provided for exchanging data between two machines via TCP/IP. Networks
  combined by TCP/IP, comprising a worldwide network, are also called
  <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">the Internet.</span>”</span>
 </p><p>
  RFC stands for <span class="emphasis"><em>Request for Comments</em></span>. RFCs are documents
  that describe various Internet protocols and implementation procedures for
  the operating system and its applications. The RFC documents describe the
  setup of Internet protocols. For more information about RFCs, see
  <a class="link" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/" target="_blank">https://datatracker.ietf.org/</a>.

     Transmission Control Protocol: a connection-oriented secure protocol. The

     Internet Control Message Protocol: This is not a protocol for the end

  As shown in <a class="xref" href="cha-network.html#fig-net-basic-OSI" title="Simplified layer model for TCP/IP">Figure 5.1, “Simplified layer model for TCP/IP”</a>, data exchange takes place in
  different layers. The actual network layer is the insecure data transfer via
  IP (Internet protocol). On top of IP, TCP (transmission control protocol)
  guarantees, to a certain extent, security of the data transfer. The IP layer
  is supported by the underlying hardware-dependent protocol, such as Ethernet.
 </p><div class="figure" id="fig-net-basic-OSI"><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a href="images/net_basic_osi.png"><img src="images/net_basic_osi.png" width="75%" alt="OSI and TCP" title="OSI and TCP"/></a></div></div><div class="title-container"><div class="figure-title-wrap"><div class="figure-title"><span class="title-number-name"><span class="title-number">Figure 5.1: </span><span class="title-name">Simplified layer model for TCP/IP </span></span><a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="cha-network.html#fig-net-basic-OSI">#</a></div></div><div class="icons"><a target="_blank" class="icon-reportbug" title="Report an issue"> </a><a target="_blank" class="icon-editsource" href="https://github.com/SUSE/doc-sle/edit/main/xml/net_basic.xml" title="Edit source document"> </a></div></div></div><p>
  The diagram provides one or two examples for each layer. The layers are
  ordered according to <span class="emphasis"><em>abstraction levels</em></span>. The lowest
  layer is very close to the hardware. The uppermost layer, however, is almost
  a complete abstraction from the hardware. Every layer has its own special
  function. The special functions of each layer are mostly implicit in their
  description. The data link and physical layers represent the physical network
  used, such as Ethernet.
 </p><p>
  Almost all hardware protocols work on a packet-oriented basis. The data to
  transmit is collected into <span class="emphasis"><em>packets</em></span> (it cannot be sent
  all at once). The maximum size of a TCP/IP packet is approximately 64 KB.
  Packets are normally quite small, as the network hardware can be a limiting
  factor. The maximum size of a data packet on Ethernet is about fifteen
  hundred bytes. The size of a TCP/IP packet is limited to this amount when the
  data is sent over Ethernet. If more data is transferred, more data packets
  need to be sent by the operating system.
 </p><p>
  For the layers to serve their designated functions, additional information
  regarding each layer must be saved in the data packet. This takes place in
  the <span class="emphasis"><em>header</em></span> of the packet. Every layer attaches a small
  block of data, called the protocol header, to the front of each emerging
  packet. A sample TCP/IP data packet traveling over an Ethernet cable is
  illustrated in <a class="xref" href="cha-network.html#fig-net-basic-TCPPaket" title="TCP/IP Ethernet packet">Figure 5.2, “TCP/IP Ethernet packet”</a>. The proof sum is
  located at the end of the packet, not at the beginning. This simplifies
  things for the network hardware.
 </p><div class="figure" id="fig-net-basic-TCPPaket"><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a href="images/net_basic_tcppacket.png"><img src="images/net_basic_tcppacket.png" width="75%" alt="TCP/IP Ethernet packet" title="TCP/IP Ethernet packet"/></a></div></div><div class="title-container"><div class="figure-title-wrap"><div class="figure-title"><span class="title-number-name"><span class="title-number">Figure 5.2: </span><span class="title-name">TCP/IP Ethernet packet </span></span><a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="cha-network.html#fig-net-basic-TCPPaket">#</a></div></div><div class="icons"><a target="_blank" class="icon-reportbug" title="Report an issue"> </a><a target="_blank" class="icon-editsource" href="https://github.com/SUSE/doc-sle/edit/main/xml/net_basic.xml" title="Edit source document"> </a></div></div></div><p>
  When an application sends data over the network, the data passes through each
  layer, all implemented in the Linux kernel except the physical layer. Each
  layer is responsible for preparing the data so it can be passed to the next
  layer. The lowest layer is ultimately responsible for sending the data. The
  entire procedure is reversed when data is received. Like the layers of an
  onion, in each layer the protocol headers are removed from the transported
  data. Finally, the transport layer is responsible for making the data
  available for use by the applications at the destination. In this manner, one
  layer only communicates with the layer directly above or below it. For
  applications, it is irrelevant whether data is transmitted via a wireless or
  wired connection. Likewise, it is irrelevant for the data line which kind of
  data is transmitted, as long as packets are in the correct format.

    Every computer on the Internet has a unique 32-bit address. These 32 bits
    (or 4 bytes) are normally written as illustrated in the second row in
    <a class="xref" href="cha-network.html#aus-net-basic-ipaddress" title="Writing IP addresses">Example 5.1, “Writing IP addresses”</a>.
   </p><div class="example" id="aus-net-basic-ipaddress" data-id-title="Writing IP addresses"><div class="title-container"><div class="example-title-wrap"><div class="example-title"><span class="title-number-name"><span class="title-number">Example 5.1: </span><span class="title-name">Writing IP addresses </span></span><a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="cha-network.html#aus-net-basic-ipaddress">#</a></div></div><div class="icons"><a target="_blank" class="icon-reportbug" title="Report an issue"> </a><a target="_blank" class="icon-editsource" href="https://github.com/SUSE/doc-sle/edit/main/xml/net_basic.xml" title="Edit source document"> </a></div></div><div class="example-contents"><div class="verbatim-wrap"><pre class="screen">IP Address (binary):  11000000 10101000 00000000 00010100

    In decimal form, the four bytes are written in the decimal number system,
    separated by periods. The IP address is assigned to a host or a network
    interface. It can be used only once throughout the world. There are
    exceptions to this rule, but these are not relevant to the following
    passages.
   </p><p>
    The points in IP addresses indicate the hierarchical system. Until the
    1990s, IP addresses were strictly categorized in classes. However, this
    system proved too inflexible and was discontinued. Now, <span class="emphasis"><em>classless
    routing</em></span> (CIDR, classless interdomain routing) is used.
   </p></section><section class="sect2" id="sec-network-addresses-route" data-id-title="Netmasks and routing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><div class="title-container"><h3 class="title"><span class="title-number-name"><span class="title-number">5.1.2 </span><span class="title-name">Netmasks and routing</span></span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="cha-network.html#sec-network-addresses-route">#</a></h3><div class="icons"><a target="_blank" class="icon-reportbug" title="Report an issue"> </a><a target="_blank" class="icon-editsource" href="https://github.com/SUSE/doc-sle/edit/main/xml/net_basic.xml" title="Edit source document"> </a></div></div></div></div></div><p>
    Netmasks are used to define the address range of a subnet. If two hosts are
    in the same subnet, they can reach each other directly. If they are not in
    the same subnet, they need the address of a gateway that handles all the
    traffic for the subnet. To check if two IP addresses are in the same
    subnet, simply <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">AND</span>”</span> both addresses with the netmask. If the
    result is identical, both IP addresses are in the same local network. If
    there are differences, the remote IP address, and thus the remote
    interface, can only be reached over a gateway.
   </p><p>
    To understand how the netmask works, look at
    <a class="xref" href="cha-network.html#tab-net-basic-netmask" title="Linking IP addresses to the netmask">Example 5.2, “Linking IP addresses to the netmask”</a>. The netmask consists of 32 bits
    that identify how much of an IP address belongs to the network. All those
    bits that are <code class="literal">1</code> mark the corresponding bit in the IP
    address as belonging to the network. All bits that are <code class="literal">0</code>
    mark bits inside the subnet. This means that the more bits are
    <code class="literal">1</code>, the smaller the subnet is. Because the netmask always
    consists of several successive <code class="literal">1</code> bits, it is also
    possible to count the number of bits in the netmask. In
    <a class="xref" href="cha-network.html#tab-net-basic-netmask" title="Linking IP addresses to the netmask">Example 5.2, “Linking IP addresses to the netmask”</a> the first net with 24 bits could
    also be written as <code class="literal">192.168.0.0/24</code>.

    cable are usually located in the same subnet and are directly accessible.
    Even when the subnet is physically divided by switches or bridges, these
    hosts can still be reached directly.
   </p><p>
    IP addresses outside the local subnet can only be reached if a gateway is
    configured for the target network. In the most common case, there is only
    one gateway that handles all traffic that is external. However, it is also
    possible to configure several gateways for different subnets.
   </p><p>
    If a gateway has been configured, all external IP packets are sent to the
    appropriate gateway. This gateway then attempts to forward the packets in
    the same manner—from host to host—until it reaches the
    destination host or the packet's TTL (time to live) expires.

   Because of the emergence of the World Wide Web (WWW), the Internet has
   experienced explosive growth, with an increasing number of computers
   communicating via TCP/IP in the past fifteen years. Since Tim Berners-Lee at
   CERN (<a class="link" href="http://public.web.cern.ch" target="_blank">http://public.web.cern.ch</a>) invented the WWW in
   1990, the number of Internet hosts has grown from a few thousand to about a
   hundred million.
  </p><p>
   As mentioned, an IPv4 address consists of only 32 bits. Also, quite a few IP
   addresses are lost—they cannot be used because of the way in which
   networks are organized. The number of addresses available in your subnet is
   two to the power of the number of bits, minus two. A subnet has, for
   example, 2, 6, or 14 addresses available. To connect 128 hosts to the
   Internet, for example, you need a subnet with 256 IP addresses, from which
   only 254 are usable, because two IP addresses are needed for the structure
   of the subnet itself: the broadcast and the base network address.
  </p><p>
   Under the current IPv4 protocol, DHCP or NAT (network address translation)
   are the typical mechanisms used to circumvent the potential address
   shortage. Combined with the convention to keep private and public address
   spaces separate, these methods can certainly mitigate the shortage. To set
   up a host in an IPv4 network, you need several address items, such as the
   host's own IP address, the subnetmask, the gateway address, and maybe a name
   server address. All these items need to be known and cannot be derived from
   somewhere else.
  </p><p>
   With IPv6, both the address shortage and the complicated configuration
   should be a thing of the past. The following sections tell more about the
   improvements and benefits brought by IPv6 and about the transition from the
   old protocol to the new one.
  </p><section class="sect2" id="sec-network-ipv6-adv" data-id-title="Advantages"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><div class="title-container"><h3 class="title"><span class="title-number-name"><span class="title-number">5.2.1 </span><span class="title-name">Advantages</span></span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="cha-network.html#sec-network-ipv6-adv">#</a></h3><div class="icons"><a target="_blank" class="icon-reportbug" title="Report an issue"> </a><a target="_blank" class="icon-editsource" href="https://github.com/SUSE/doc-sle/edit/main/xml/net_basic.xml" title="Edit source document"> </a></div></div></div></div></div><p>
    The most important and most visible improvement brought by the IPv6
    protocol is the enormous expansion of the available address space. An IPv6
    address is made up of 128 bit values instead of the traditional 32 bits.
    This provides for as many as several quadrillion IP addresses.
   </p><p>
    However, IPv6 addresses are not only different from their predecessors with
    regard to their length. They also have a different internal structure that
    may contain more specific information about the systems and the networks to
    which they belong. More details about this are found in
    <a class="xref" href="cha-network.html#sec-network-ipv6-address" title="5.2.2. Address types and structure">Section 5.2.2, “Address types and structure”</a>.
   </p><p>
    The following is a list of other advantages of the IPv6 protocol:
   </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt id="id-1.8.4.2.14.6.5.1"><span class="term">Autoconfiguration</span></dt><dd><p>
       IPv6 makes the network <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">plug and play</span>”</span> capable, which means
       that a newly configured system integrates into the (local) network
       without any manual configuration. The new host uses its automatic
       configuration mechanism to derive its own address from the information
       made available by the neighboring routers, relying on a protocol called
       the <span class="emphasis"><em>neighbor discovery</em></span> (ND) protocol. This method
       does not require any intervention on the administrator's part and there
       is no need to maintain a central server for address allocation—an
       additional advantage over IPv4, where automatic address allocation
       requires a DHCP server.
      </p><p>
       Nevertheless if a router is connected to a switch, the router should
       send periodic advertisements with flags telling the hosts of a network
       how they should interact with each other. For more information, see
       RFC 2462 and the <code class="systemitem">radvd.conf(5)</code> man page, and
       RFC 3315.
      </p></dd><dt id="id-1.8.4.2.14.6.5.2"><span class="term">Mobility</span></dt><dd><p>
       IPv6 makes it possible to assign several addresses to one network
       interface at the same time. This allows users to access several networks
       easily, something that could be compared with the international roaming
       services offered by mobile phone companies. When you take your mobile
       phone abroad, the phone automatically logs in to a foreign service when
       it enters the corresponding area, so you can be reached under the same
       number everywhere and can place an outgoing call, as you would in your
       home area.
      </p></dd><dt id="id-1.8.4.2.14.6.5.3"><span class="term">Secure communication</span></dt><dd><p>
       With IPv4, network security is an add-on function. IPv6 includes IPsec
       as one of its core features, allowing systems to communicate over a
       secure tunnel to avoid eavesdropping by outsiders on the Internet.
      </p></dd><dt id="id-1.8.4.2.14.6.5.4"><span class="term">Backward compatibility</span></dt><dd><p>
       Realistically, it would be impossible to switch the entire Internet from
       IPv4 to IPv6 at one time. Therefore, it is crucial that both protocols
       can coexist not only on the Internet, but also on one system. This is
       ensured by compatible addresses (IPv4 addresses can easily be translated
       into IPv6 addresses) and by using several tunnels. See
       <a class="xref" href="cha-network.html#sec-network-ipv6-coexist" title="5.2.3. Coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6">Section 5.2.3, “Coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6”</a>. Also, systems can rely on a
       <span class="emphasis"><em>dual stack IP</em></span> technique to support both protocols
       at the same time, meaning that they have two network stacks that are
       completely separate, such that there is no interference between the two
       protocol versions.
      </p></dd></dl></div></section><section class="sect2" id="sec-network-ipv6-address" data-id-title="Address types and structure"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><div class="title-container"><h3 class="title"><span class="title-number-name"><span class="title-number">5.2.2 </span><span class="title-name">Address types and structure</span></span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="cha-network.html#sec-network-ipv6-address">#</a></h3><div class="icons"><a target="_blank" class="icon-reportbug" title="Report an issue"> </a><a target="_blank" class="icon-editsource" href="https://github.com/SUSE/doc-sle/edit/main/xml/net_basic.xml" title="Edit source document"> </a></div></div></div></div></div><p>
    As mentioned, the current IP protocol has two major limitations: there is
    an increasing shortage of IP addresses and configuring the network and
    maintaining the routing tables is becoming a more complex and burdensome
    task. IPv6 solves the first problem by expanding the address space to
    128 bits. The second one is mitigated by introducing a hierarchical address
    structure combined with sophisticated techniques to allocate network
    addresses, and <span class="emphasis"><em>multihoming</em></span> (the ability to assign
    several addresses to one device, giving access to several networks).
   </p><p>
    When dealing with IPv6, it is useful to know about three different types of
    addresses:
   </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt id="id-1.8.4.2.14.7.4.1"><span class="term">Unicast</span></dt><dd><p>
       Addresses of this type are associated with exactly one network
       interface. Packets with such an address are delivered to only one
       destination. Accordingly, unicast addresses are used to transfer packets
       to individual hosts on the local network or the Internet.
      </p></dd><dt id="id-1.8.4.2.14.7.4.2"><span class="term">Multicast</span></dt><dd><p>
       Addresses of this type relate to a group of network interfaces. Packets
       with such an address are delivered to all destinations that belong to
       the group. Multicast addresses are mainly used by certain network
       services to communicate with certain groups of hosts in a well-directed
       manner.
      </p></dd><dt id="id-1.8.4.2.14.7.4.3"><span class="term">Anycast</span></dt><dd><p>
       Addresses of this type are related to a group of interfaces. Packets
       with such an address are delivered to the member of the group that is
       closest to the sender, according to the principles of the underlying
       routing protocol. Anycast addresses are used to make it easier for hosts
       to find out about servers offering certain services in the given network
       area. All servers of the same type have the same anycast address.
       Whenever a host requests a service, it receives a reply from the server
       with the closest location, as determined by the routing protocol. If
       this server should fail for some reason, the protocol automatically
       selects the second closest server, then the third one, and so forth.
      </p></dd></dl></div><p>
    An IPv6 address is made up of eight four-digit fields, each representing 16
    bits, written in hexadecimal notation. They are separated by colons
    (<code class="literal">:</code>). Any leading zero bytes within a given field may be
    dropped, but zeros within the field or at its end may not. Another
    convention is that more than four consecutive zero bytes may be collapsed
    into a double colon. However, only one such <code class="literal">::</code> is
    allowed per address. This kind of shorthand notation is shown in
    <a class="xref" href="cha-network.html#aus-net-ipv6-add" title="Sample IPv6 address">Example 5.3, “Sample IPv6 address”</a>, where all three lines represent the
    same address.

    Each part of an IPv6 address has a defined function. The first bytes form
    the prefix and specify the type of address. The center part is the network
    portion of the address, but it may be unused. The end of the address forms
    the host part. With IPv6, the netmask is defined by indicating the length
    of the prefix after a slash at the end of the address. An address, as shown
    in <a class="xref" href="cha-network.html#aus-net-ipv6-addpre" title="IPv6 address specifying the prefix length">Example 5.4, “IPv6 address specifying the prefix length”</a>, contains the information that the
    first 64 bits form the network part of the address and the last 64 form its
    host part. In other words, the <code class="literal">64</code> means that the netmask
    is filled with 64 1-bit values from the left. As with IPv4, the IP address
    is combined with AND with the values from the netmask to determine whether
    the host is located in the same subnet or in another one.

       IPv4 addresses and IPv4 over IPv6 compatibility addresses. These are
       used to maintain compatibility with IPv4. Their use still requires a
       router able to translate IPv6 packets into IPv4 packets. Several special
       addresses, such as the one for the loopback device, have this prefix as
       well.

       Aggregatable global unicast addresses. As is the case with IPv4, an
       interface can be assigned to form part of a certain subnet. Currently,
       there are the following address spaces:
       <code class="systemitem">2001::/16</code> (production quality
       address space) and <code class="systemitem">2002::/16</code>
       (6to4 address space).
      </p></dd><dt id="id-1.8.4.2.14.7.10.4"><span class="term"><code class="systemitem">fe80::/10</code></span></dt><dd><p>
       Link-local addresses. Addresses with this prefix should not be routed
       and should therefore only be reachable from within the same subnet.
      </p></dd><dt id="id-1.8.4.2.14.7.10.5"><span class="term"><code class="systemitem">fec0::/10</code></span></dt><dd><p>
       Site-local addresses. These may be routed, but only within the network
       of the organization to which they belong. In effect, they are the IPv6
       equivalent of the current private network address space, such as
       <code class="systemitem">10.x.x.x</code>.
      </p></dd><dt id="id-1.8.4.2.14.7.10.6"><span class="term"><code class="systemitem">ff</code></span></dt><dd><p>
       These are multicast addresses.
      </p></dd></dl></div><p>
    A unicast address consists of three basic components:
   </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt id="id-1.8.4.2.14.7.12.1"><span class="term">Public topology</span></dt><dd><p>
       The first part (which also contains one of the prefixes mentioned above)
       is used to route packets through the public Internet. It includes
       information about the company or institution that provides the Internet
       access.
      </p></dd><dt id="id-1.8.4.2.14.7.12.2"><span class="term">Site topology</span></dt><dd><p>
       The second part contains routing information about the subnet to which
       to deliver the packet.
      </p></dd><dt id="id-1.8.4.2.14.7.12.3"><span class="term">Interface ID</span></dt><dd><p>
       The third part identifies the interface to which to deliver the packet.
       This also allows for the MAC to form part of the address. Given that the
       MAC is a globally unique, fixed identifier coded into the device by the
       hardware maker, the configuration procedure is substantially simplified.
       In fact, the first 64 address bits are consolidated to form the
       <code class="literal">EUI-64</code> token, with the last 48 bits taken from the
       MAC, and the remaining 24 bits containing special information about the
       token type. This also makes it possible to assign an
       <code class="literal">EUI-64</code> token to interfaces that do not have a MAC,
       such as those based on point-to-point protocol (PPP).
      </p></dd></dl></div><p>
    On top of this basic structure, IPv6 distinguishes between five different
    types of unicast addresses:
   </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt id="id-1.8.4.2.14.7.14.1"><span class="term"><code class="systemitem">::</code> (unspecified)</span></dt><dd><p>
       This address is used by the host as its source address when the

       cannot yet be determined by other means).

       The IPv6 address is formed by the IPv4 address and a prefix consisting
       of 96 zero bits. This type of compatibility address is used for
       tunneling (see <a class="xref" href="cha-network.html#sec-network-ipv6-coexist" title="5.2.3. Coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6">Section 5.2.3, “Coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6”</a>) to allow IPv4
       and IPv6 hosts to communicate with others operating in a pure IPv4
       environment.

       There are two address types for local use:

          This type of address can only be used in the local subnet. Packets
          with a source or target address of this type should not be routed to
          the Internet or other subnets. These addresses contain a special
          prefix (<code class="systemitem">fe80::/10</code>) and the
          interface ID of the network card, with the middle part consisting of
          zero bytes. Addresses of this type are used during automatic
          configuration to communicate with other hosts belonging to the same
          subnet.

          Packets with this type of address may be routed to other subnets, but
          not to the wider Internet—they must remain inside the
          organization's own network. Such addresses are used for intranets and
          are an equivalent of the private address space defined by IPv4. They
          contain a special prefix
          (<code class="systemitem">fec0::/10</code>), the interface
          ID, and a 16-bit field specifying the subnet ID. Again, the rest is
          filled with zero bytes.

    As a completely new feature introduced with IPv6, each network interface
    normally gets several IP addresses, with the advantage that several
    networks can be accessed through the same interface. One of these networks
    can be configured completely automatically using the MAC and a known prefix
    with the result that all hosts on the local network can be reached when
    IPv6 is enabled (using the link-local address). With the MAC forming part
    of it, any IP address used in the world is unique. The only variable parts
    of the address are those specifying the <span class="emphasis"><em>site topology</em></span>
    and the <span class="emphasis"><em>public topology</em></span>, depending on the actual
    network in which the host is currently operating.
   </p><p>
    For a host to go back and forth between different networks, it needs at
    least two addresses. One of them, the <span class="emphasis"><em>home address</em></span>,
    not only contains the interface ID but also an identifier of the home
    network to which it normally belongs (and the corresponding prefix). The
    home address is a static address and, as such, it does not normally change.
    Still, all packets destined to the mobile host can be delivered to it,
    regardless of whether it operates in the home network or somewhere outside.
    This is made possible by the completely new features introduced with IPv6,
    such as <span class="emphasis"><em>stateless autoconfiguration</em></span> and
    <span class="emphasis"><em>neighbor discovery</em></span>. In addition to its home address, a
    mobile host gets one or more additional addresses that belong to the
    foreign networks where it is roaming. These are called
    <span class="emphasis"><em>care-of</em></span> addresses. The home network has a facility
    that forwards any packets destined to the host when it is roaming outside.
    In an IPv6 environment, this task is performed by the <span class="emphasis"><em>home
    agent</em></span>, which takes all packets destined to the home address and
    relays them through a tunnel. On the other hand, those packets destined to
    the care-of address are directly transferred to the mobile host without any
    special detours.

    The migration of all hosts connected to the Internet from IPv4 to IPv6 is a
    gradual process. Both protocols will coexist for some time to come. The
    coexistence on one system is guaranteed where there is a <span class="emphasis"><em>dual
    stack</em></span> implementation of both protocols. That still leaves the
    question of how an IPv6 enabled host should communicate with an IPv4 host
    and how IPv6 packets should be transported by the current networks, which
    are predominantly IPv4-based. The best solutions offer tunneling and
    compatibility addresses (see <a class="xref" href="cha-network.html#sec-network-ipv6-address" title="5.2.2. Address types and structure">Section 5.2.2, “Address types and structure”</a>).
   </p><p>
    IPv6 hosts that are more or less isolated in the (worldwide) IPv4 network
    can communicate through tunnels: IPv6 packets are encapsulated as IPv4
    packets to move them across an IPv4 network. Such a connection between two
    IPv4 hosts is called a <span class="emphasis"><em>tunnel</em></span>. To achieve this,
    packets must include the IPv6 destination address (or the corresponding
    prefix) and the IPv4 address of the remote host at the receiving end of the
    tunnel. A basic tunnel can be configured manually according to an agreement
    between the hosts' administrators. This is also called <span class="emphasis"><em>static
    tunneling</em></span>.
   </p><p>
    However, the configuration and maintenance of static tunnels is often too
    labor-intensive to use them for daily communication needs. Therefore, IPv6
    provides for three different methods of <span class="emphasis"><em>dynamic
    tunneling</em></span>:
   </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt id="id-1.8.4.2.14.8.5.1"><span class="term">6over4</span></dt><dd><p>
       IPv6 packets are automatically encapsulated as IPv4 packets and sent
       over an IPv4 network capable of multicasting. IPv6 is tricked into
       seeing the whole network (Internet) as a huge local area network (LAN).
       This makes it possible to determine the receiving end of the IPv4 tunnel
       automatically. However, this method does not scale very well and is also
       hampered because IP multicasting is far from widespread on the Internet.
       Therefore, it only provides a solution for smaller corporate or
       institutional networks where multicasting can be enabled. The
       specifications for this method are laid down in RFC 2529.
      </p></dd><dt id="id-1.8.4.2.14.8.5.2"><span class="term">6to4</span></dt><dd><p>
       With this method, IPv4 addresses are automatically generated from IPv6
       addresses, enabling isolated IPv6 hosts to communicate over an IPv4
       network. However, several problems have been reported regarding the
       communication between those isolated IPv6 hosts and the Internet. The
       method is described in RFC 3056.
      </p></dd><dt id="id-1.8.4.2.14.8.5.3"><span class="term">IPv6 tunnel broker</span></dt><dd><p>
       This method relies on special servers that provide dedicated tunnels for
       IPv6 hosts. It is described in RFC 3053.

    To configure IPv6, you normally do not need to make any changes on the
    individual workstations. IPv6 is enabled by default. To disable or enable
    IPv6 on an installed system, use the YaST <span class="guimenu">Network
    Settings</span> module. On the <span class="guimenu">Global Options</span> tab,
    select or deselect the <span class="guimenu">Enable IPv6</span> option as necessary.
    
    To enable it temporarily until the next reboot, enter
    <code class="command">modprobe</code> <code class="option">-i ipv6</code> as
    <code class="systemitem">root</code>. It is impossible to unload
    the IPv6 module after it has been loaded.
   </p><p>
    Because of the autoconfiguration concept of IPv6, the network card is
    assigned an address in the <span class="emphasis"><em>link-local</em></span> network.
    Normally, no routing table management takes place on a workstation. The
    network routers can be queried by the workstation, using the
    <span class="emphasis"><em>router advertisement protocol</em></span>, for what prefix and
    gateways should be implemented. The radvd program can be used to set up an
    IPv6 router. This program informs the workstations which prefix to use for
    the IPv6 addresses and which routers. Alternatively, use zebra/quagga for
    automatic configuration of both addresses and routing.

   DNS assists in assigning an IP address to one or more names and assigning a
   name to an IP address. In Linux, this conversion is usually carried out by a
   special type of software known as bind. The machine that takes care of this
   conversion is called a <span class="emphasis"><em>name server</em></span>. The names make up a
   hierarchical system in which each name component is separated by a period.
   The name hierarchy is, however, independent of the IP address hierarchy
   described above.
  </p><p>
   Consider a complete name, such as
   <code class="systemitem">jupiter.example.com</code>, written in the
   format <code class="systemitem">hostname.domain</code>. A full
   name, called a <span class="emphasis"><em>fully qualified domain name</em></span> (FQDN),
   consists of a host name and a domain name
   (<code class="systemitem">example.com</code>). The latter
   also includes the <span class="emphasis"><em>top level domain</em></span> or TLD
   (<code class="systemitem">com</code>).
  </p><p>
   TLD assignment has become quite confusing for historical reasons.
   Traditionally, three-letter domain names are used in the USA. In the rest of
   the world, the two-letter ISO national codes are the standard. In addition
   to that, longer TLDs were introduced in 2000 that represent certain spheres
   of activity (for example, <code class="systemitem">.info</code>,
   <code class="systemitem">.name</code>,
   <code class="systemitem">.museum</code>).
  </p><p>
   In the early days of the Internet (before 1990), the file
   <code class="filename">/etc/hosts</code> was used to store the names of all the
   machines represented over the Internet. This quickly proved to be
   impractical in the face of the rapidly growing number of computers connected
   to the Internet. For this reason, a decentralized database was developed to
   store the host names in a widely distributed manner. This database, similar
   to the name server, does not have the data pertaining to all hosts in the
   Internet readily available, but can dispatch requests to other name servers.
  </p><p>
   The top of the hierarchy is occupied by <span class="emphasis"><em>root name
   servers</em></span>. These root name servers manage the top level domains and
   are run by the Network Information Center (NIC). Each root name server knows
   about the name servers responsible for a given top level domain. Information
   about top level domain NICs is available at
   <a class="link" href="http://www.internic.net" target="_blank">http://www.internic.net</a>.
  </p><p>
   DNS can do more than resolve host names. The name server also knows which
   host is receiving e-mails for an entire domain—the <span class="emphasis"><em>mail
   exchanger (MX)</em></span>.
  </p><p>
   For your machine to resolve an IP address, it must know about at least one
   name server and its IP address.  
  </p><div id="id-1.8.4.2.15.9" data-id-title="MDNS and .local domain names" class="admonition note normal"><img class="symbol" alt="Note" title="Note" src="static/images/icon-note.svg"/><div class="admon-title">Note: MDNS and .local domain names</div><p>
    The <code class="literal">.local</code> top level domain is treated as link-local
    domain by the resolver. DNS requests are sent as multicast DNS requests
    instead of normal DNS requests. If you already use the
    <code class="literal">.local</code> domain in your name server configuration, you
    must switch this option off in <code class="filename">/etc/host.conf</code>. For
    more information, see the <code class="filename">host.conf</code> manual page.
   </p><p>
    To switch off MDNS during installation, use <code class="literal">nomdns=1</code> as
    a boot parameter.
